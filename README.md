## Code guidelines
Our folder structure is based on atomic design. Read more about atomic design [here](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [here](https://medium.com/joeydinardo/a-brief-look-at-atomic-components-39cbe71d38b5), and find an example project [here](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc).

#### Atomic design
`src/components` is split into the following folders:

- `src/components/atoms`: An **atom** is the most basic component, that renders only HTML tags (i.e., they don't import other components). An atom should represent the smallest possible component within which it wouldnâ€™t make sense to abstract further. For example, an input label, or a button.
- `src/components/molecules`: A **molecule** is a group of atoms bonded together to form a small and re-usable UI element. For example a `SearchForm` molecule is the group of the following atoms: `InputLabel`, `Input`, and `Button`.
- `src/components/organisms`: An **organism** is a group of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface. For example, we can have a `Header` that consists of the following molecules: `Logo`, `Navigation`, and `SearchForm`. Organisms can use other organisms.
- `src/components/smarts`: A **smart** (or a container) is mostly responsible for connecting other components to the redux state, as well as dispatching actions to the store. It has minimal rendering logic, but it can act as a **smart organism** and render multiple organisms/molecules/atoms.
- `src/components/hocs`: A **hoc** is a [Higher-Order Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).
- `src/pages`: A **page** is a the whole UI that corresponds to a specific route.

Unit testing files should be placed in a `__tests__/` folder, relative to the file being tested.

#### Other folders
- `src/store`: Contains anything related to state management with redux. We follow most of the recommendations found [here](https://hackernoon.com/redux-step-by-step-a-simple-and-robust-workflow-for-real-life-apps-1fdf7df46092).
- `src/services`: Contains abstraction for external APIs, such as Firebase.
- `src/config`: Contains configuration variables that are internal to the frontend code. If a configuration variable needs to be exposed to the backend or to the continuous-integration script, it should be defined as a NODE ENV in `.env`.
- `src/utils`: General helper functions that are reused throughout the code.
- `.storybook`: [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) configuration files.
- `database`: Contains Firebase database rules.
- `flow-typed`: Flow types definitions.
- `functions`: Firebase functions (backend).
- `public`: Read about this folder at [create-react-app/Using the public folder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#using-the-public-folder).
- `resources`: Contains non-code files such as design files (Sketch files, PSD) and Docs.
- `stories`: [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) files.
- `test`: Contains End-to-End tests.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo locally: `git clone git@gitlab.com:pesposa/webapp.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd webapp && yarn`

## Development

`yarn start`

## Lint

`yarn lint`

## Unit testing

Run tests with watch:

```shell
yarn test:unit
```

Run once:

```shell
CI=true yarn test:unit
```

Read more at [create-react-app Docs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests).

## End-to-End Testing

1. Setup Selenium server: `yarn setup:e2e`
2. Run the e2e tests: `yarn test:e2e`

## Data tools

- Seed Firebase DB: `yarn seed`
- Sync with legacy MySQL DB: http://localhost:3000/admin

## Build

`yarn build`

## Deploy to Firebase Hosting

`yarn deploy`
