# Pesposa Web Application

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/bb/pesposa/webapp.svg?style=svg&circle-token=672fc70422242f2252d394f0f1a33ef08a27e830)](https://circleci.com/bb/pesposa/webapp)

## 1. Code guidelines
Our folder structure is based on atomic design. Read more about atomic design [here](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [here](https://medium.com/joeydinardo/a-brief-look-at-atomic-components-39cbe71d38b5), and find an example project [here](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc).

### Atomic design
`src/components` is split into the following folders:

- `src/components/atoms`: An **atom** is the most basic component, that renders only HTML tags (i.e., they don't import other components). An atom should represent the smallest possible component within which it wouldnâ€™t make sense to abstract further. For example, an input label, or a button.
- `src/components/molecules`: A **molecule** is a group of atoms bonded together to form a small and re-usable UI element. For example a `SearchForm` molecule is the group of the following atoms: `InputLabel`, `Input`, and `Button`.
- `src/components/organisms`: An **organism** is a group of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface. For example, we can have a `Header` that consists of the following molecules: `Logo`, `Navigation`, and `SearchForm`. Organisms can use other organisms.
- `src/components/smarts`: A **smart** (or a container) is mostly responsible for connecting other components to the redux state, as well as dispatching actions to the store. It has minimal rendering logic, but it can act as a **smart organism** and render multiple organisms/molecules/atoms.
- `src/components/hocs`: A **hoc** is a [Higher-Order Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).
- `src/pages`: A **page** is a the whole UI that corresponds to a specific route.

Unit testing files should be placed in a `__tests__/` folder, relative to the file being tested.

### Other folders
- `src/store`: Contains anything related to state management with redux. We follow most of the recommendations found [here](https://hackernoon.com/redux-step-by-step-a-simple-and-robust-workflow-for-real-life-apps-1fdf7df46092).
- `src/services`: Contains abstraction for external APIs, such as Firebase.
- `src/config`: Contains configuration variables that are internal to the frontend code. If a configuration variable needs to be exposed to the backend or to the continuous-integration script, it should be defined as a NODE ENV in `.env`.
- `src/utils`: General helper functions that are reused throughout the code.
- `.storybook`: [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) configuration files.
- `database`: Contains Firebase database rules.
- `flow-typed`: Flow types definitions.
- `functions`: Firebase functions (backend).
- `public`: Read about this folder at [create-react-app/Using the public folder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#using-the-public-folder).
- `resources`: Contains non-code files such as design files (Sketch files, PSD) and Docs.
- `stories`: [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) files.
- `test`: Contains End-to-End tests.

## 2. Development

1. Clone the repo locally: `git clone git@gitlab.com:pesposa/webapp.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd webapp && yarn`

### `yarn start`
Run the app in development mode.

### `yarn lint`
Lint all code.

### `yarn test:unit`
Run unit tests with watch.

### `CI=true yarn test:unit`
Run unit tests once.

### `yarn test:unit -- --coverage`
Run unit tests once and generate coverage report.

### `yarn test:e2e`
Run end-to-end tests with Nightwatch. Make sure you run `yarn setup:e2e` to install Selenium.

### Tools
1. [Firebase Tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools): `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
2. CircleCI CLI: Visit https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-jobs/#nav-button and follow the instructions.

<!-- ### Data tools -->
<!-- - Seed Firebase DB: `yarn seed` -->
<!-- - Sync with legacy MySQL DB: http://localhost:3000/admin -->

## 3. Deploy
We use CircleCI to automatically deploy the latest code to Firebase Hosting. You can find CircleCI configuration at `.circleci/config.yml`. You should never need to run the following commands manually, besides `yarn admin` for setting a new deployment.

### `yarn admin initialize`
Seed a Firebase DB, and initial import to Algolia. You should typically run this to setup a new deployment.

### `yarn build`
Build all the apps (UI, functions, database, admin).

### `yarn deploy`
Deploy all apps Firebase Hosting.

## 5. Environment Variables
Find variables inherited by create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#advanced-configuration).

## 4. Deployments
Name | Branch  | Description
:--- | :---: | :---:
Development | `dev` | After passing tests on CI, the latest code is deployed here (in `development` mode). This environment does not share any resources (database, algolia, etc.) with the production environment. Access is restricted to development team.
Staging | `staging` | Runs the "next" version of the application, i.e., the release candidate. It is an exact mirror of the production environment, and shares the same resources (database, algolia, etc.) as the production environment. This environment is used for stress testing and comprehensive QA. Access is restricted to development team.
Production | `production` | Runs the currently released version of the application.
